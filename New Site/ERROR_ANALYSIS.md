# ERROR DETECTION AND FIXES

## Potential Issues I've Identified:

### 1. üîç **Iframe Height Issues**
- Changed from fixed height to min-height might cause display problems
- The iframe might not be communicating properly with parent

### 2. üîç **CSS Color Conflicts** 
- Changing primary color might affect Bootstrap components unexpectedly
- White color might make some elements invisible

### 3. üîç **Navigation JavaScript Issues**
- Bootstrap collapse functionality might be affected
- Menu items might not be clickable

### 4. üîç **File Path Issues**
- Removed extra space from DOCTYPE but other formatting issues might exist

## Quick Test:
1. Open http://localhost:8080/index.html
2. Check if home.html loads in the iframe
3. Check if navigation menu works (try clicking "Home" or "Partners")
4. Check if mobile menu works (resize browser or use mobile view)

## Most Likely Issue:
Based on your message, I suspect the **iframe is not displaying content properly** or the **navigation is broken**.

## Immediate Rollback Available:
If needed, we can quickly revert to backup files and start fresh with a more careful approach.

**What specific error are you seeing?** 
- Blank page?
- Navigation not working?
- Home.html not loading?
- Styling issues?
- JavaScript errors?

This will help me target the exact problem!
